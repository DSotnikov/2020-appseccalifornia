<p><b>AppSec Cali is packed with great talks by an international lineup of great speakers, top level all-day training classes, lots of prize giveaways, and parties during its 4 days at the beach in Santa Monica, California.</b></p>  
<p>Ask yourself: “Do I want to go to the office, or would I rather go to the beach for two, three, or four days?“
If you live in the north, would you rather dig your car out of snow/ice on a few fine January mornings, or go to the beach?
Go ahead, make your day, and ours, too!</p>
