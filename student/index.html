<p>
Students are eligible to receive a 2-day conference registration ticket for only $99 (75% discount). The student conference ticket is good only for the conference dates on January 23-24, 2019, but not for any training session.

A valid .EDU Email is required to register as a student. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the cancellation of your registration ticket. You must present your valid student ID issued by an accredited university to check-in at the conference desk onsite.

Please email us at Appsec-cali-info@owasp.org if you have questions or have difficulty in registering for the conference.
